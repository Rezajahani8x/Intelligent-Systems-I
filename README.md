# Intelligent-Systems-I
In this project, some machine learning models are implemented and trained. In addition, a convex optimization problem is solved.

This project consist of three sections.

- Section 1
    * In this section a binary logistic regression model is implemented and trained.
    * The model is trained via Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent.

- Section 2
    * In this section a convex optimization problem is solved.
    * The method employed for solving the problem is Newton method.
    * In the last part, a genetic algorithm is developed for solving the porblem.

- Section 3
    * In this section a SVM model is implemented and trained.
    * Testing the model, the performance of this model is evaluated.
